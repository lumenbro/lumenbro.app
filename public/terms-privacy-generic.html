        <p class="footnote">Last Updated: June 8, 2025</p>

        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing or using the LumenBro Trading Bot ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Privacy Policy ("Agreement"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
        <p>LumenBro is a trading bot on the Stellar network, enabling automated PathPayment swaps, trade size scaling, adjustable slippage, and wallet rankings based on on-chain data. The Service is provided "as is" and may be updated or discontinued at any time without notice.</p>

        <h3>3. Acceptable Use</h3>
        <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes. You may not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract proprietary code or data.</li>
          <li>Use the Service to harm, disrupt, or exploit the Stellar network or other users.</li>
          <li>Engage in unauthorized access, including probing for vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>All code, designs, and features of LumenBro are owned by LumenBro and protected by intellectual property laws. Unauthorized use or reproduction is prohibited.</p>

        <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>LumenBro is not liable for losses arising from your use of the Service, including trading losses or security breaches due to user error.</p>

        <h3>6. Termination</h3>
        <p>LumenBro may suspend or terminate your access for violating this Agreement or engaging in suspicious activity, without prior notice.</p>

        <h3>7. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States, California. Any disputes will be resolved in California courts.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>LumenBro ("we," "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the Service or interact with our website (lumenbro.com).</p>

        <h3>2. Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>We may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wallet Data:</strong> Public Stellar wallet addresses and trade metrics (e.g., XLM transaction hashes and volume) for referral program purposes. Wallet rankings are generated using on-chain data, not user-submitted data.</li>
          <li><strong>Embedded Wallet Data:</strong> Sub-organization identifiers, key identifiers, public keys, and status flags stored in our shared PostgreSQL database, used for secure wallet management. Session keys are encrypted with AWS KMS before storage; plaintext session keys are never stored.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> IP addresses, browser information, and interaction logs when you access our website or Telegram bot.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Telegram ID, email addresses, or X handles provided for feedback or inquiries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <p>Your data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and improve the Service, including calculating referral program credits and monitoring system performance.</li>
          <li>Manage wallets and sessions, including session creation consistent with our shared KMS configuration.</li>
          <li>Respond to your inquiries or feedback.</li>
          <li>Monitor and prevent unauthorized access or abuse of the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seed Phrases:</strong> Generated and displayed once during registration; we do not store or access your seed phrases. Users can export their private keys at any time from the Wallet Management tab. Exports display the Stellar S‑address and allow viewing upon registration with Export Wallet.</li>
          <li><strong>Private Keys (via provider):</strong> Private keys are stored within an audited, secure infrastructure operated by the embedded wallet provider. Keys are never exposed to LumenBro servers; signing operations are performed through provider APIs on your behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>Sessions:</strong> Session keys are encrypted via AWS KMS (Key ID 27958fe3-0f3f-44d4-b21d-9d820d5ad96c, Region us-west-1) prior to database storage and are decrypted only by authorized services.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Usage and contact data are stored securely on AWS infrastructure, with access restricted to authorized personnel.</li>
          <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined or as required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
          <li>With service providers (e.g., AWS, embedded wallet providers) under strict confidentiality and security obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Request access to or deletion of your data, or use the <code>/unregister</code> command in the Telegram bot to clear all data.</li>
          <li>Opt out of data collection by discontinuing use of the Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@lumenbro.com">info@lumenbro.com</a> to exercise these rights.</p>

        <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The Service integrates with Telegram, embedded wallet providers, AWS, and the Stellar network. Their respective privacy policies apply to data processed on those platforms.</p>

        <h3>8. Contact</h3>
        <p>For questions or concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@lumenbro.com">info@lumenbro.com</a> or @Lumen_Bro on X.</p>
